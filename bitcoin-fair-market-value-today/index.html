I can access it through login.yahoo.com. My business email is an @ yahoo email. Yahoo mail on my chrome laptop will not let me login to one of my yahoo email accounts, but it will let me login to a different yahoo email account. In yahoo mail, you can send high priority emails by marking them as high importance. when composing a new email, click on the three dots in the toolbar at the bottom. Or is it that you're providing same phone number to create a different yahoo. If you are using your cox.net email address and password for your cox my account information, that. Microsoft doesn't even allow its users to login to their proton mail or tutanota mail accounts.</p>
