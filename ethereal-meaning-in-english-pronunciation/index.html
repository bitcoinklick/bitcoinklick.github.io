            </p><p>To my recollecton, in the early phase personal use was free. The support agent had him install. He was prenteding to be from. From what i can tell this virus has modified windows system files so it wont be detected. I was able to reinstall my premium malwarebytes but scan did not find it. Came across this earlier today, getting a quote together for a client. On 11/24/20 i was trying to update a garmin hand held gps and selected the wrong garmin site that ended up directing me to an on line agent that requested i call a 800 support. Anyone had a chance to try it out?</p>
