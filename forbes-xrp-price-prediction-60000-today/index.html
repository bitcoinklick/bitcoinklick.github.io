In other words, independent sources point to an underperformance of 48%. Forbes, meanwhile, independently estimates his current net worth to be $4.5 billion. A trip to asda revealed viera d300 led tvs (24, 43) made by vestel. Does anyone know or guess why only series 1 &amp; 2 have ever been released when there's actually six series? Series 1 actually had three hosts, andi peters, emma forbes and john barrowman, think he was involved in series 2 but just done electric circus, mitch johnson. What might cause a slight confusion is that one of the characters maggie forbes played by the late jill gascoigne, was carried over from the lwt series the gentle touch. We often have discussions on here about what radio presenters get paid, and how it varies greatly depending on the presenter, the station, the show etc.</p>
