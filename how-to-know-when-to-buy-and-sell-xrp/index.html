            </p><p>'know of' is used when you have personal. Alright, well, for example, like on saturdays, y’know, what i liked to do. Do is the present tense, so saying do you know would ask if you currently know. For me, know implies knowledge of details or individual pieces, while am aware of implies a knowledge only of a whole. Recently one of my friends told me that there is distinct difference between 'know of something' and 'know about something' expressions. Therefore, saying did you know asks if you have previously known something. 7 when someone makes an assertion, the distinction between how did you know and how do you know seems to be that how did you know implies that the person in. Can it be used in formal conversation/writing?</p>
