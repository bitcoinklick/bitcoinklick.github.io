            </p><p>Regrettably, the service has been dropped caused by due to lack of funding. Dear teachers, i have a question about the following sentence, in the u.s., advances in technology and equipment contributed to layoffs, causing chocolate employment to slide 2.2 percent. During the year 2018, equipment 1 did not work at a sufficient level which caused important amounts of dust to arrive in equipment 2. In the case of the first sentence, you can easily use. For i we have the x such that x caused the trouble was a faulty switch: I want to ask, what will be used for or to ? He caused me a lot of difficulties = he caused a lot of difficulties for / to me. The winds were so strong that they created a great deal of damage.</p>
