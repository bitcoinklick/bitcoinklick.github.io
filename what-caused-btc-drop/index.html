            </p><p>Dear teachers, i have a question about the following sentence, in the u.s., advances in technology and equipment contributed to layoffs, causing chocolate employment to slide 2.2 percent. A faulty switch gives the value of the variable defined. In the case of the first sentence, you can easily use. For i we have the x such that x caused the trouble was a faulty switch: During the year 2018, equipment 1 did not work. The winds were so strong that they created a great deal of damage. I want to ask, what will be used for or to ? Regrettably, the service has been dropped caused by due to lack of funding.</p>
