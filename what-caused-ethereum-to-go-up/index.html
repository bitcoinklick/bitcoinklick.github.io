            </p><p>The winds were so strong that they created a great deal of damage. During the year 2018, equipment 1 did not work at a sufficient level which caused important amounts of dust to arrive in equipment 2. I have a question that troubles me. The caused is optional, in my opinion. I what caused the trouble was a faulty switch. He caused me a lot of difficulties = he caused a lot of difficulties for / to me. Dear teachers, i have a question about the following sentence, in the u.s., advances in technology and equipment contributed to layoffs, causing chocolate employment to slide 2.2 percent.
