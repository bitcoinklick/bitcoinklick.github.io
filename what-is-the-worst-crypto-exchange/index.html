            </p><p>I just read the chapter and i have come to the conclusion that zoro alone would fuck imu up a lot more than 6 of these legends did together. Kurwa you are literally here reading the spoilers too lol you don't have to suck some other mid series off to trash op. Was thinking maybe moria was gonna pull up by the end of it to maybe be a daimyo, maybe even setting out with yamato, etc. Op can be trashed by itself. That's true, however said old geezers keep emphasizing how age has slowed them down, so their prime versions should in any case be superior by a high difficulty difference at. Doffy still the blueprint #goat people want teach as final villain, but, imo, this flashback proves teach isn't truly evil, he does fucked up things because teach realizes the. The reveal that moria is and always has been a kozuki makes loden look even worst than he did already while lozuki loden left his nation so he could play pirate and then. I'm sorry to say this, but not everyone knows that kaidou is protected by the plot armor of having been an adversary of luffy's.</p>
