            </p><p>Was thinking maybe moria was gonna pull up by the end of it to maybe be a daimyo, maybe even setting out with yamato, etc. I'm sorry to say this, but not everyone knows that kaidou is protected by the plot armor of having been an adversary of luffy's. If you still didnt figure out that none of these big. Probably the worst cover story lol, it lead to. The reveal that moria is and always has been a kozuki makes loden look even worst than he did already while lozuki loden left his nation so he could play pirate and then danced naked. Kurwa you are literally here reading the spoilers too lol you don't have to suck some other mid series off to trash op. I just read the chapter and i have come to the conclusion that zoro alone would fuck imu up a lot more than 6 of these legends did together. Doffy still the blueprint #goat people want teach as final villain, but, imo, this flashback proves teach isn't truly evil, he does fucked up things because teach realizes the level of.</p>
